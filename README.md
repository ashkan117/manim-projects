  A picture is 1000 words. In an era of countless medium posts information gets lost in an ocean of even more information. Furthermore, sometimes a paraghraph doesn't do a concept any favors. That's where manim comes into play. I did not enjoy math until I stumbled upon 3Blue1Brown. Single handedly he changed my entire view on learning. It should be engaging, fun, and treated as a puzzle. This unlocked a world of possibilities for me. Instead of creating something entirely knew I'm experimenting with adding to already great resources.

## Pass Reference By Value
  It took me almost two years after I started learning Java to actually discover that Java is entirely pass by value.This goes to show you that time with a language does not mean expertise. As a tip to beginning programmers don't code to just make things work. Understand why things are the way they are. When you run into an issue don't just google until you find a solution then move on. Reflect on misconceptions you might have had or why the soloution eluded you.

This example is aiming to illustrate a [great answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value) to the question.


## Resources
  I wish I had known about the [community branch](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) with their very useful [documentation](https://manimce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) especially the [building blocks](https://manimce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/building_blocks.html)
